Observer is a story-driven 2D platform adventure created for the TapTap Spotlight Challenge 2025. The player embarks on a journey through surreal landscapes, uncovering hidden memories and interacting with mysterious NPCs. The project highlights my focus on atmospheric level design, character control systems, and Unity-based narrative integration.
